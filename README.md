# Function Visualizer

A simple C program that uses [raylib](https://www.raylib.com) to visually represent a quadratic function of the form `ax^2 + bx + c`. This program includes GUI sliders to manipulate the coefficients a, b, and c, allowing you to see the graphical changes in real-time.

## Folder Structure
- `Main/main.cpp`: The main program file
- `Includes`: Folder that contains the raylib header files
- `Commands/make.sh`: Bash script to build and run the program

## Building the Program
1. Install [raylib](https://www.raylib.com/downloads.html)
2. Compile `Main/main.cpp` with `./Commands/make.sh`

## Usage
1. Run the compiled program
2. Use the sliders to adjust the coefficients a, b, and c
3. Observe the real-time graphical changes in the function
